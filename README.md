# Stopwatch_Project

STOPWATCH PROJECT (Made by using HTML5 CSS3 and JavaScript)

ABOUT THIS PROJECT-:

This project involves the development of a simple stopwatch application. The stopwatch consists of three buttons: "Start," "Stop," and "Reset," which allow the user to control its functionality.

When the user clicks the "Start" button, the stopwatch begins counting time. The displayed time is updated every second, showing the elapsed time since the start in the format "HH:MM:SS". The "Start" button becomes disabled to prevent multiple start commands.

To pause the stopwatch, the user can click the "Stop" button. This action halts the timer and preserves the elapsed time. The "Start" button becomes enabled again, allowing the user to resume the stopwatch from where they left off.

To reset the stopwatch to its initial state, the user can click the "Reset" button. This action clears the elapsed time and sets it back to "00:00:00". The "Start" button becomes enabled, ready for a fresh start.

The project utilizes HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to achieve the desired functionality. HTML is used to structure the elements of the stopwatch, including the time display and buttons. CSS3 is employed to style the stopwatch, ensuring an appealing visual appearance. JavaScript handles the logic behind the stopwatch, including time calculations, button functionalities, and updating the display in real-time.

Overall, this stopwatch project provides a user-friendly interface for measuring elapsed time, making it suitable for various timing-related tasks or activities.
